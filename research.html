  <h2>Research Programme</h2>
 <p> Lattice Polymers, also known as lattice random walks, are a rich set of models describing the universal geometric and topological behaviour of long chain polymers 
	 which are ubiquitous in the world around us, from paints and plastics to the DNA in our cells. These models provide key insights into the behaviour of such polymers, 
	 but they also have deep connections to a variety of other models in mathematical physics, combinatorics and probability theory. 
	 Their study allows us to uncover both new physical phenomena and new mathematical structures.</p>

My major programs of work are

<h3> Integrable lattice polymer models at the interface of algebra, analysis and combinatorics</h3>

 <p>Lattice paths, which model the geometry of polymers, play an important role in modern combinatorics and mathematical physics, 
	and the resolution of these models has drawn on such diverse fields as algebra, probability theory and complex analysis. 
	The projects I conduct aim to use a range of sophisticated techniques to expand the diversity and utility of solvable polymer models, 
	which interface with the rich topic of integrable lattice models in statistical mechanics. </p>
	
	<p>The fundamental aim of these projects is to push forward the frontier of exactly solvable lattice path polymer models by:</p>
<ol>
<li> Generalising the types of lattice path models to new, more diverse, polymer systems.</li>

<li> Applying sophisticated techniques to develop new methods for solving these models, and analysing their universal critical behaviour and phase diagrams.</li>

<li> Developing principles for understanding the scope of the methods by studying the relationship between the symmetries of the models and their solvability.</li>
</ol>
 <p>Expected outcomes include powerful new mathematical and computational tools in combinatorics and statistical physics..</p>



<h3>Next generation simulation of polymer systems in complex environments</h3>

 <p>Elucidating the behaviour of long chain polymers using computer simulations, in various environments and experiencing physical and chemical interactions, 
	has yielded a growing bank of results and insights over decades. 
	The suite of projects here aims to apply next generation computational techniques to tackle the new frontier of polymer simulations, 
	and in particular polymers with complex interactions and those with complicated topologies like stars, knots and links which have hitherto been inaccessible. 
	Expected outcomes include new simulation methods designed to make use of modern computational clusters, and numerical estimates for the fundamental quantities driving polymer behaviour. T
	he aims are to further develop Monte Carlo algorithms for long chain polymers which run in highly parallel systems, making use of modern computational clusters with many CPU cores.</p>

 <p>These will lead to a greater understanding of complex polymer systems, which are widespread in chemistry, biology, and manufacturing.</p>

        <span id="kreweras2" style="display: none">Lattice paths in the quarter plane have led to a large and varied set of results in recent years. 
        One major project has been the classification of step sets according to the properties of the corresponding generating functions, and this has involved a variety of techniques, 
        some highly intricate and specialised. The famous Kreweras and reverse Kreweras walk models are two particularly interesting models, 
        as they are among the only four cases which have algebraic generating functions. <br />
<br />
        Here we investigate how the properties of the Kreweras and reverse Kreweras models change when boundary interactions are introduced. 
        That is, we associate three real-valued weights a,b,c with visits by the walks to the x-axis, the y-axis and the origin (0,0) respectively. 
        These models were partially solved in a recent paper by Beaton, Owczarek and Rechnitzer (2019). We apply the algebraic kernel method to completely solve these two models. 
        We find that reverse Kreweras walks have an algebraic generating function for all a,b,c, 
        regardless of whether the walks are restricted to end at the origin or on one of the axes, or may end anywhere at all. For Kreweras walks, 
        the generating function for walks returning to the origin is algebraic, but the other cases are only D-finite.  <br />
<br />
        We also compare these two models with the other solvable cases, and observe that they have some unique properties.</span>

        Here we revisit this problem discussing various non-standard scaling hypotheses and showing how these best fit the available data.

        <span id="countcompl" style="display: none"> 
Recently, an exhaustive study has been made of the corrections-to-scaling for the number of, and various size measures 
(eg. radius of gyration) of, self-avoiding walks on the various two-dimensional lattices. This study gave compelling evidence 
that the first non-analytic correction-to-scaling has exponent △1 = 3⁄2. However, there also exist predictions in the literature 
for the corrections-to-scaling of the number of nearest neighbour contacts of self-avoiding walks. These are partially based on the 
analysis of relatively short series. Here we demonstrate that the form for the scaling of the number of self-avoiding walks recently proposed, 
and some standard scaling assumptions, implies that this older conjecture on the corrections-to-scaling for the number of 
nearest neighbour contacts is unlikely to hold. We consolidate this claim by the analysis of Monte Carlo data for both 
two and three dimensional self-avoiding walks. 
This work also shows that the often standard assumption that all quantities have the same corrections-to-scaling is misleading. </span>

  difference equations.  The difference equations are 
  encoded by the action of various ``transfer matrices''.  
  We state several theorems that demonstrate how the 
  coordinate Bethe Ansatz for the eigenvectors of the 
  transfer matrices, given certain conditions hold, is 
  equivalent to the Gessel-Viennot determinant for the 
  number of configurations of $N$ non-intersecting lattice 
  paths on the directed square lattice.  Another way of 
  viewing this result is that it is a linear algebra proof 
  of the Gessel-Viennot theorem for the particular case 
  considered in this paper.  This is significant as the 
  Bethe Ansatz is potentially capable of solving various 
  lattice paths problems, such as osculating lattice paths, 
  which are beyond the scope of the Gessel-Viennot theorem. </span>

      Lattice polymers near a permeable interface<br />

        <span id="permeable" style="display: none">We study the localisation of lattice polymer models near a permeable interface in two dimensions. 
        Localisation can arise due to an interaction between the polymer and the interface, and can be altered by a preference for the bulk solvent on one side
         or by the application of a force to manipulate the polymer. Different combinations of these three effects give slightly different statistical mechanical behaviours. 
         The canonical lattice model of polymers is the self-avoiding walk which we mainly study with Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the phase diagram and critical phenomena. 
         For comparison, a solvable directed walk version is also defined and the phase diagrams are compared for each case. We find broad agreement between the two models, 
         and most minor differences can be understood as due to the different entropic contributions. 
         In the limit where the bulk solvent on one side is overwhelmingly preferred we see how the localisation transition transforms to the adsorption transition; 
         the permeable interface becomes effectively an impermeable surface. </span>

        The exact solution of this model is computed in three different ways, depending on whether $t$ is less than, equal to or greater than 1. 
        In all cases a complete expression for the dominant asymptotic behaviour of the partition function is calculated. 
        The model admits a dilute to dense phase transition, where for $0 < t < 1$ the partition function 
        scales exponentially in $L$ whereas for $t>1$ the partition function scales exponentially in $L^2$, 
        and when $t=1$ there is an intermediate scaling which is exponential in $L \log{L}$.

  Critical behaviour of the extended-ballistic transition for pulled self-avoiding walks <br />

        <span id="extbal" style="display: none"> In order to study long chain polymers many lattice models 
        accommodate a pulling force applied to a particular part of the chain, often a free endpoint. 
        This is in addition to well-studied features such as energetic interaction between the lattice polymer and a surface. 
        However, the critical behaviour of the pulling force alone is less well studied, such as characterising the nature of the 
        phase transition and particularly the values of the associated exponents. We investigate a simple model of lattice polymers 
        subject to forced extension, namely self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on the square and simple cubic lattices with one endpoint attached 
        to an impermeable surface and a force applied to the other endpoint acting perpendicular to the surface.
         In the thermodynamic limit the system undergoes a transition to a ballistic phase as the force is varied and
          it is known that this transition occurs whenever the magnitude of the force is positive, i.e.f > f_c=0. 
          Using well established scaling arguments we show that the crossover exponent phi
 for the finite-size model is identical to the well-known exponent  nu_d, which controls the scaling of the size of the polymer in 
d-dimensions. With extensive Monte Carlo simulations we test this conjecture and show that the value of phi
 is indeed consistent with the known values of nu_2=3/4
 and nu_3 =0.587597(7). Scaling arguments, in turn, imply the specific heat exponent alpha
 is 2/3
 in two dimensions and 0.29815(2)
 in three dimensions. </span>

        <span id="trailinh" style="display: none"> The study of the effect of random impurities on the collapse of a flexible polymer
         in dilute solution has had recent attention with consideration of semi-stiff interacting self-avoiding walks on the square lattice. 
         In the absence of impurities the model displays two types of collapsed phase, one of which is both anisotropically ordered and maximally dense 
         (crystal-like). In the presence of impurities the study showed that the crystal type phase disappears. Here we investigate
         extended interacting self-avoiding trails on the triangular lattice with random impurities. Without impurities this model 
         also displays two collapsed phases, one of which is maximally dense but not ordered anisotropically and so may be affected 
         differently by a disorderd lattice. The trails are simulated using the flatPERM algorithm and the inhomogeneity is 
         realised by making a random fraction of the lattice unavailable to the trails. We calculate several thermodynamic and 
         metric quantities to map out the phase diagram and look at how the amount of disorder affects the properties of each phase 
         but especially the maximally dense phase. Our results indicate that while the maximally dense phase in the trail model is 
         affected less than in the walk model it is also disrupted and becomes a denser version of the globule phase so that the model 
         with impurities displays no more than one true thermodynamic collapsed phase.

        density inside large boxes goes to zero, to a ‘dense’ phase, where there is a finite positive density. 
        We prove various bounds on the free energy and develop a scaling theory for the phase transition based on the 
        standard theory for unconstrained polymers. We compare this model to unrestricted walks and walks that whose 
        endpoints are fixed at the opposite corners of a box, as well as Hamiltonian walks. We use Monte Carlo simulations 
        to verify predicted values for three key exponents: the density exponent alpha =1/2, the finite size crossover exponent 
 1/nu=4/3 and the critical partition function exponent 2-eta = 43/32. 
 This implies that the theoretical framework relating them to the unconstrained SAW problem is valid. </span>

        <span id="sawsquare" style="display: none"> We have studied self-avoiding walks contained within an L × L square 
        whose end-points can lie anywhere within, or on, the boundaries of the square. We prove that such walks behave, 
        asymptotically, as walks crossing a square (WCAS), being those walks whose end-points lie at the south-east and north-west 
        corners of the square. We provide numerical data, enumerating all such walks, and analyse the sequence of coefficients 
        in order to estimate the asymptotic behaviour. We also studied a subset of these walks, those that must contain at least 
        one edge on all four boundaries of the square. We provide compelling evidence that these two classes of walks grow identically.
         From our analysis we conjecture that the number of such walks CL, for both problems, behaves as
C_L \sim lambda^{L^2+bL+c} L^g,
where (Guttmann and Jensen 2022 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.) λ = 1.744 5498 ± 0.000 0012, 
b = −0.043 54 ± 0.0005, c = −1.35 ± 0.45, and g = 3.9 ± 0.1. Finally, we also studied 
the equivalent problem for self-avoiding polygons, also known as cycles in a square grid. 
The asymptotic behaviour of cycles has the same form as walks, but with different values of the parameters c, and g.
 Our numerical analysis shows that λ and b have the same values as for WCAS and that c = 1.776 ± 0.002 while g = −0.500 ± 0.005 
 and hence probably equals -1/2. </span>

		On a homogeneous lattice this model has an extended phase and two distinct collapsed phases, globular and crystalline, which differ in the anisotropy of the walks.

        Each branch of the 3-star lattice is modelled as a self-avoiding walk (SAW) on the simple cubic lattice 
        with one endpoint of each branch joined at a common node. Recent theoretical work van Rensburg and Whittington 
        (2018 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 51 204001) found four phases for this system: free, fully adsorbed, ballistic and mixed. 
        The mixed phase occurs between the ballistic and fully adsorbed phase. 
        We investigate this system by using the flatPERM Monte Carlo algorithm with special restrictions 
        on the endpoint moves to simulate 3-stars up to branch length 128. We provide numerical evidence of the 
        four phases and in particular that the ballistic-mixed and adsorbed-mixed phase boundaries are first-order transitions. 
        The position of the ballistic-mixed and adsorbed-mixed boundaries are found at the expected location in the asymptotic 
        regime of large force and large surface-monomer interaction energy. 
        These results indicate that the flatPERM algorithm is suitable for simulating star lattice polymers

In two dimensions polymer collapse has been shown to be complex with multiple low temperature states and multi-critical points. 
Recently, strong numerical evidence has been provided for a long-standing prediction of universal scaling of winding angle distributions,
where simulations of interacting self-avoiding walks show that the winding angle distribution for N-step walks is compatible with the 
theoretical prediction of a Gaussian with a variance growing asymptotically as C log N. Here we extend this work by considering interacting 
self-avoiding trails which are believed to be a model representative of some of the more complex behaviour. We provide robust evidence that, while the high temperature swollen state of this model has a winding angle distribution that is also Gaussian, this breaks down at the polymer collapse point and at low temperatures. Moreover, we provide some evidence that the distributions are well modelled by stretched/compressed exponentials, in contradistinction to the behaviour found in interacting self-avoiding walks. </span>

        <span id="univads" style="display: none"> Recently, it has been proposed that the adsorption transition for a 
        single polymer in dilute solution, modeled by lattice walks in three dimensions, is not universal with respect 
        to intermonomer interactions. Moreover, it has been conjectured that key critical exponents 𝜙, measuring the
         growth of the contacts with the surface at the adsorption point, and 1/𝛿, which measures the finite-size shift
          of the critical temperature, are not the same. However, applying standard scaling arguments the two key critical 
          exponents should rather be identical, hence pointing to a potential breakdown of these standard scaling arguments.
           Both of these conjectures are in contrast to the well-studied situation in two dimensions, where there are exact 
           results from conformal field theory: these exponents are both accepted to be 1/2 and universal. We use the flatPERM 
           algorithm to simulate self-avoiding walks and trails on the hexagonal, square, and simple cubic lattices up to length 
           1024 to investigate these claims. Walks can be seen as a repulsive limit of intermonomer interaction for trails, 
           allowing us to probe the universality of adsorption. For each lattice model we analyze several thermodynamic properties
            to produce different methods of estimating the critical temperature and the key exponents. We test our methodology 
            on the two-dimensional cases, and the resulting spread in values for 𝜙 and 1/𝛿 indicates that there is a systematic 
            error which can far exceed the statistical error usually reported. We further suggest a methodology for consistent 
            estimation of the key adsorption exponents which gives 𝜙=1/𝛿=0.484⁢(4) in three dimensions. Hence, we conclude that 
            in three dimensions these critical exponents indeed differ from the mean-field value of 1/2, as had previously been 
            calculated, 
        but cannot find evidence that they differ from each other. Importantly, we also find no substantive evidence of any 
        nonuniversality in the polymer adsorption transition. </span>

        <span id="adsneigha" style="display: none"> We investigate neighbor-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice
         in the presence of an adsorbing surface. This class of lattice paths has been less studied using Monte Carlo 
         simulations. Our investigation follows on from our previous results using self-avoiding walks and self-avoiding trails.
          The connection is that neighbor-avoiding walks are equivalent to the infinitely repulsive limit of self-avoiding walks
           with monomer-monomer interactions. Such repulsive interactions can be seen to enhance the excluded volume effect.
            We calculate the critical behavior of the adsorption transition for neighbor-avoiding walks, 
            finding a critical temperature of 𝑇a=3.274⁢(9) and a crossover exponent of 𝜙=0.482⁢(13), w
            hich is consistent with the exponent for self-avoiding walks and trails, 
            leading to an overall combined estimate for three dimensions of 𝜙3D=0.484⁢(7).

We study via Monte Carlo simulation a generalisation of the so-called vertex interacting 
self-avoiding walk (VISAW) model on the square lattice. The configurations are actually 
not self-avoiding walks but rather restricted self-avoiding trails (bond avoiding paths) 
which may visit a site of the lattice twice provided the path does not cross itself: to 
distinguish this subset of trails we shall call these configurations grooves. Three
 distinct interactions are added to the configurations: firstly the VISAW interaction, 
 which is associated with doubly visited sites, secondly a nearest neighbour interaction
  in the same fashion as the canonical interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) and thirdly,
   a stiffness energy to enhance or decrease the probability of bends in the configuration.

In addition to the normal high temperature phase we find three low temperature phases: 
(i) the usual amorphous liquid drop-like 'globular' phase, (ii) an anisotropic 'β-sheet' 
phase with dominant configurations consisting of aligned long straight segments, which 
has been found in semi-flexible nearest neighbour ISAW models, and (iii) a maximally dense 
phase, where the all sites of the path are associated with doubly visited sites (except 
those of the boundary of the configuration), previously observed in interacting self-avoiding trails.

We construct a phase diagram using the fluctuations of the energy parameters and three order parameters.
 The β-sheet and maximally dense phases do not seem to meet in the phase space and are always separated 
 by either the extended or globular phases. We focus attention on the transition between the extended 
 and maximally dense phases, as that is the transition in the original VISAW model. We find that for 
 the path lengths considered there is a range of parameters where the transition is first order 
 and it is otherwise continuous. </span>

        <span id="threebody" style="display: none"> Various interacting lattice path models of polymer collapse in
        two dimensions demonstrate different critical behaviours. This difference has been without a clear explanation.
         The collapse transition has been variously seen to be in the Duplantier–Saleur θ-point university class 
         (specific heat cusp), the interacting trail class (specific heat divergence) or even first-order. 
         Here we study via Monte Carlo simulation a generalisation of the Duplantier–Saleur model on the honeycomb 
         lattice and also a generalisation of the so-called vertex-interacting self-avoiding walk model 
         (configurations are actually restricted trails known as grooves) on the triangular lattice. 
         Crucially for both models we have three- and two-body interactions explicitly and differentially weighted.
          We show that both models have similar phase diagrams when considered in these larger two-parameter spaces. 
          They demonstrate regions for which the collapse transition is first-order for high three-body interactions 
          and regions where the collapse is second order. We conjecture a higher order multiple critical point 
          separating these two types of collapse.
         It remains to be tested whether the second order lines in both models are in the Duplantier–Saleur θ-point 
         university class for all values of the parameters. </span>

we apply this technique in two different instances to establish partial solutions for two 
simplified generating functions of the same underlying model that ignore either surface or 
shared contacts. We then subsequently combine our two partial solutions to find the solution 
for the full generating function in terms of the two simpler variants. This expression

         taken to infinity before the width of the slit is considered to become large, to the opposite situation where the 
         order of the limits are swapped, known as the half-plane limit when one polymer is modelled. In contrast with the

        <span id="sfsat" style="display: none"> Self-avoiding walks self-interacting via nearest neighbours (ISAW) 
        and self-avoiding trails interacting via multiply-visited sites (ISAT) are two models of the polymer collapse 
        transition of a polymer in a dilute solution. On the square lattice it has been established numerically that 
        the collapse transition of each model lies in a different universality class.
It has been shown that by adding stiffness to the ISAW model a second low temperature phase eventuates and a more 
complicated phase diagram ensues with three types of transition that meet at a multi-critical point. For large enough 
stiffness the collapse transition becomes first order. Interestingly, a phase diagram of a similar structure has been 
seen to occur in an extended ISAT model on the triangular lattice without stiffness. It is therefore of interest to see 
the effect of adding stiffness to the ISAT model.
We have studied by computer simulation a generalised model of self-interacting self-avoiding trails on the square 
lattice with a stiffness parameter added. Intriguingly, we find that stiffness does not change the order of the 
collapse transition for ISAT on the square lattice for a very wide range of stiffness weights. While at the 
lengths considered there are clear bimodal distributions for very large stiffness, our numerical evidence strongly 
suggests that these are simply finite-size effects associated with a crossover to a first-order phase transition at infinite stiffness.

Self-avoiding walks and self-avoiding trails, two models of a polymer coil in dilute solution, 
have been shown to be governed by the same universality class. On the other hand, self-avoiding 
walks interacting via nearest-neighbour contacts (ISAW) and self-avoiding trails interacting via 
multiply visited sites (ISAT) are two models of the coil-globule, or collapse transition of a 
polymer in dilute solution. On the square lattice it has been established numerically that the 
collapse transition of each model lies in a different universality class. The models differ in 
two substantial ways. They differ in the types of subsets of random walk configurations utilized 
(site self-avoidance versus bond self-avoidance) and in the type of attractive interaction. It is 
therefore of some interest to consider self-avoiding trails interacting via nearest-neighbour attraction 
(INNSAT) in order to ascertain the source of the difference in the collapse universality class.
 Using the flatPERM algorithm, we have performed computer simulations of this model. We present 
 numerical evidence that the singularity in the free energy of INNSAT at the collapse transition 
 has a similar 
exponent to that of the ISAW model rather than the ISAT model. This would indicate that the type 
of interaction used in ISAW and ISAT is the source of the difference in the universality class. </span>

        that distinguishes two topologically different types of self-interaction: namely, crossings 
        where the trail passes across itself and collisions where the lattice path visits the same 
        site without crossing. This model generalizes the canonical interacting self-avoiding trail 
        model of polymer collapse, which has a strongly divergent specific heat at its transition point. 
        We confirm the recent prediction that the asymmetry does not affect the universality class 
        for a range of asymmetry. Certainly, where the weighting of collisions outweighs that of 
        crossings this is well supported numerically. 
        When crossings are weighted heavily relative to collisions, the collapse transition reverts 
        to the canonical 𝜃-point-like behavior found in interacting self-avoiding walks. </span>

        (1989 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 22 1415) and it describes polymers with some attraction, 
        providing thus a model for the polymer collapse transition. At a particular set of Boltzmann 
        weights the model is integrable and the exponents ν = 12/23 ≈ 0.522 and γ = 53/46 ≈ 1.152 have

        <span id="anomtrail3d" style="display: none"> Trails (bond-avoiding walks) provide an alternative lattice model
         of polymers to self-avoiding walks, and adding self-interaction at multiply visited sites gives a 
         model of polymer collapse. Recently a two-dimensional model (triangular lattice) where doubly and 
         triply visited sites are given different weights was shown to display a rich phase diagram with 
         first- and second-order collapse separated by a multicritical point. A kinetic growth process of 
         trails (KGTs) was conjectured to map precisely to this multicritical point. Two types of 
         low-temperature phases, a globule phase and a maximally dense phase, were encountered. 
         Here we investigate the collapse properties of a similar extended model of interacting 
         lattice trails on the simple cubic lattice with separate weights for doubly and triply visited sites.
          Again we find first- and second-order collapse transitions dependent on the relative sizes of the 
          doubly and triply visited energies. However, we find no evidence of a low-temperature maximally 
          dense phase with only the globular phase in existence. Intriguingly, when the ratio of the energies 
          is precisely that which separates the first-order from the second-order regions anomalous 
          finite-size scaling appears. At the finite-size location of the rounded transition clear 
          evidence exists for a first-order transition that persists in the thermodynamic limit. 
          This location moves as the length increases, with its limit apparently at the point that maps to a KGT.
           However, if one fixes the temperature to sit at exactly this KGT point, then only a 
           critical point can be deduced from the data. The resolution of this apparent contradiction lies in the 
        breaking of crossover scaling and the difference in the shift and transition width (crossover) exponents. </span>

         of a semi-flexible polymer that has one end tethered to a sticky wall, while a pulling force away 
         from the adsorbing surface acts on the free end of the walk. This model generalizes a number of 
         previously considered adsorption models by incorporating individual horizontal and vertical stiffness effects,
          in competition with a variable pulling angle. A solution to the corresponding generating function 
          is found by means of the kernel method. While the phases and related phase transitions are similar 
          in nature to those found previously the analysis of the model in terms of its physical variables 
          highlights various novel structures in the shapes of the phase diagrams and related behaviour of the polymer. 
          We review the results of previously considered sub-cases, augmenting these findings to include analysis with 
          respect to the model's physical variables—namely, temperature, pulling force, pulling angle away from the surface, 
          stiffness strength and the ratio of vertical to horizontal stiffness potentials, with our subsequent analysis for the 
          general model focusing on the effect that stiffness has on this pulling angle range. In analysing the model with 
          stiffness we also pay special attention to the case where only vertical stiffness is included. 
          The physical analysis of this case reveals behaviour more closely resembling that of an upward pulling force
           acting on a polymer than it does of a model where horizontal stiffness acts. The stiffness–temperature phase diagram
            exhibits re-entrance for low temperatures, previously only seen for three-dimensional or co-polymer models. 
            For the most general model we delineate the shift in the physical behaviour as we change the ratio of vertical to horizontal stiffness between the horizontal-only
         and the vertical-only stiffness regimes. We find that a number of distinct physical characteristics 
         will only be observed for a model where the vertical stiffness dominates the horizontal stiffness. </span>

       <span id="meetpoint" style="display: none"> We have investigated a polymer growth process on the triangular lattice
        where the configurations produced are self-avoiding trails. We show that the scaling behavior of this process is 
        similar to the analogous process on the square lattice. However, while the square lattice process maps to the 
        collapse transition of the canonical interacting self-avoiding trail (ISAT) model on that lattice, 
        the process on the triangular lattice model does not map to the canonical equilibrium model. On the other hand,
         we show that the collapse transition of the canonical ISAT model on the triangular lattice behaves in a way 
         reminiscent of the 𝜃 point of the interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) model, which is the standard model of polymer collapse. 
         This implies an unusual lattice dependency of the ISAT collapse transition in two dimensions. By studying an extended ISAT model, 
         we demonstrate that the growth process maps to a multicritical point in a larger parameter space. 
         In this extended parameter space the collapse phase transition may be either 𝜃-point-like (second order) 
         or first order, and these two are separated by a multicritical point. It is this multicritical point to which the growth process maps. 
         Furthermore, we provide evidence that in addition to the high-temperature gaslike swollen polymer phase (coil) 
         and the low-temperature liquid-drop-like collapse phase (globule) there is also a maximally dense crystal-like phase (crystal)
          at low temperatures dependent on the parameter values. The multicritical point is the meeting point of these three phases. 
       Our hypothesized phase diagram resolves the mystery of the seemingly differing behaviors of the ISAW and ISAT models 
       in two dimensions as well as the behavior of the trail growth process. </span>

        <span id="shhbnhb" style="display: none"> We investigate the addition of stiffness to the lattice model of 
        hydrogen-bonded polymers in two and three dimensions. We find that, in contrast to polymers that interact 
        via a homogeneous short-range interaction, the collapse transition is unchanged by any amount of stiffness: 
        this supports the physical argument that hydrogen bonding already introduces an effective stiffness. 
        Contrary to possible physical arguments, favouring bends in the polymer does not return the model’s behaviour 
        to that comparable with the semi-flexible homogeneous interaction model, where the canonical 
-point occurs for a range of parameter values. In fact, for sufficiently large bending energies the 
crystal phase disappears altogether, and no phase transition of any type occurs. We also compare the 
order-disorder transition from the globule phase to crystalline phase in the semi-flexible 
homogeneous interaction model to that for the fully-flexible hybrid model with both hydrogen and non-hydrogen 
like interactions. We show that these phase transitions are of the same type and are a novel polymer critical phenomena 
in two dimensions. That is, it is confirmed that in two dimensions this transition is second-order, unlike in 
three dimensions where it is known to be first order. We also estimate the crossover exponent in two dimensions 
and show that there is a divergent specific heat, finding

        which is self-interacting and can undergo a collapse transition, subject to an applied tensile force. We review and
         interpret all the results already in the literature concerning the case where this force is in the preferred direction
          of the walk. We consider the force extension curves at different temperatures as well as the critical-force temperature curve.
           We demonstrate that this model can be analysed rigorously for all key quantities of interest even when 
           there may not be explicit expressions for these quantities available. We show which of the techniques available
            can be extended to the full model, where the force has components in the preferred direction and the direction 
            perpendicular to this. Whilst the solution of the generating function is available, its analysis is far more 
            complicated and not all the rigorous techniques are available. However, many results can be extracted including
             the location of the critical point which gives the general critical-force temperature curve. 
        Lastly, we generalize the model to a three-dimensional analogue and show that several key properties

        confined to a slit of finite width and interacting with the walls of the slit via an attractive 
        potential has been recently calculated. The walks can be considered to model the polymer-induced 
        steric stabilization and sensitized flocculation of colloidal dispersions. The large-width asymptotics 
        led to a phase diagram different to that of a polymer attached to, and attracted to, a single wall. 
        The question that arises is: Can one interpolate between the single wall and two wall cases? 
        In this paper, we calculate the exact scaling functions for the partition function by 
        considering the two variable asymptotics of the partition function for simultaneous 
        large length and large width. Consequently, we find the scaling functions for the 
        force induced by the polymer on the walls. We find that these scaling functions are 
        given by elliptic ϑ functions. 
        In some parts of the phase diagram there is more a complex crossover between the

        in lattice models of three-dimensional polymers when they are attached to a wall that has a 
        short-range potential. The bulk phase, where the attractive intra-polymer interactions are s
        trong enough to cause a collapse of the polymer into a liquid-like globule and the wall either
         has weak attractive or repulsive interactions, is usually denoted desorbed-collapsed or DC. 
         Recently, this DC phase was conjectured to harbour two surface phases separated by a boundary 
         where the bulk free energy is analytic while the surface free energy is singular. The surface 
         phase for more attractive values of the wall interaction is the SAG phase. We discuss in more 
         detail the properties of this proposed surface phase and provide Monte Carlo evidence for 
         self-avoiding walks up to a length 256 that this surface phase most likely does exist.

        <span id="hydisocoll" style="display: none"> We investigate a lattice model of polymers where the nearest 
        neighbour monomer–monomer interaction strengths differ according to whether the local configurations have 
        so-called 'hydrogen-like' formations or not. If the interaction strengths are all the same then the classical
         θ-point collapse transition occurs on lowering the temperature, and the polymer enters the isotropic liquid 
         drop phase known as the collapsed globule. On the other hand, strongly favouring the hydrogen-like interactions 
         gives rise to an anisotropic folded (solid-like) phase on lowering the temperature. We use Monte Carlo 
         simulations up to a length of 256 to map out the phase diagram in the plane of parameters and determine 
         the order of the associated phase transitions. We discuss the connections to semi-flexible polymers and 
         other polymer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that for a range of energy parameters, two phase transitions
          occur on lowering the temperature, the second being a transition from the globule state to the crystal state. W
          e argue from our data that this 
        globule-to-crystal transition is continuous in two dimensions in accord with field-theory arguments concerning 
        Hamiltonian walks, but is first order in three dimensions. </span>

        In this Letter we study this model on the square and simple cubic lattices for the case 𝐾 =3.

        <span id="collisat" style="display: none"> The collapse transition of an isolated polymer has been modelled by many different approaches,
         including lattice models based on self-avoiding walks and self-avoiding trails. 
         In two dimensions, previous simulations of kinetic growth trails, which map to a particular
          temperature of interacting self-avoiding trails, showed markedly different behaviour for what was 
          argued to be the collapse transition than that which has been verified for models based of self-avoiding walks.
           On the other hand, it has been argued that kinetic growth trails represent a special simulation that does 
           not give the correct picture of the standard equilibrium model. In this work we simulate the standard equilibrium 
           interacting self-avoiding trail model on the square lattice up to lengths over 2,000,000 steps and show that the 
           results of the kinetic growth simulations are, in fact, entirely in accord with standard simulations of the 
           temperature dependent model. In this way we verify that the collapse transition of interacting self-avoiding 
           walks and trails are indeed in different universality classes in two dimensions.

        <span id="pulladscoll" style="display: none"> A self-interacting polymer with one end attached to a sticky surface has been 
        studied by means of a flat-histogram stochastic growth algorithm known as FlatPERM. We examined the four-dimensional 
        parameter space of the number of monomers (up to 91), self-attraction, surface-attraction and pulling force applied to one end of the polymer. 
        Using this powerful algorithm the complete parameter space of interactions and pulling force has been considered. 
        Recently it has been conjectured that a hierarchy of states appears at low-temperature/poor solvent conditions 
        where a polymer exists in a finite number of layers close to a surface. We find re-entrant behaviour from the 
        stretched phase into these layering phases when an appropriate force is applied to the polymer. 
        Of interest is that the existence, and extent, of this re-entrant phase can be controlled 
        not only by the force, but also by the ratio of surface-attraction to self-attraction.

We also find that, contrary to what may be expected, the polymer desorbs from the surface 
when a sufficiently strong critical force is applied and does not transcend through either 
a series of de-layering transitions or monomer-by-monomer transitions. 
We discuss the problem mainly from the point of view of the stress ensemble. 
However, we make some comparisons with the strain ensemble, 
showing the broad agreement between the two ensembles while pointing out subtle differences. </span>

         We consider three geometric constraints on the ends of the polymer and concentrate on the long chain limit. 
         Apart from the general interest in the effect of geometrical confinement,
          this can be viewed as a two-dimensional model of steric stabilization and 
          sensitized flocculation of colloidal dispersions. We demonstrate that the

          the one found in a half-plane geometry, even when the polymer is constrained
           to be fixed at both ends on one wall. We are not able to find a closed form 
           solution for the free energy for finite width, at all values of the interaction 
           parameters, but we can calculate the asymptotic behaviour for large widths everywhere in the phase plane. 
           This allows us to find the force between the walls induced by the polymer and hence the regions of the plane where

Two-step restricted walk (TSRW) models are a class of restricted self-avoiding walk (SAW) where, 
in addition to the self-avoidance constraint, certain restrictions are placed upon each pair of 
successive steps. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the restrictions and the 
scaling of the average size of walks in three-dimensional models. We use the Pruned-enriched 
Rosenbluth method algorithm to perform Monte Carlo studies in five representative TSRW models 
in three dimensions. The results present strong numerical evidence that all non-trivial 
TSRW models in three dimensions have the same size scaling behaviour as unrestricted SAWs. 
This is in contrast to two dimensions where several universality classes are accepted to 
exist. In particular, we find no rule analogous to the 'spiral' walk of two dimensions.  </span>

        It is argued that the appearance of a transition (at least) as strong as a pseudo-first-order

        for ISAW than ISAT and it cannot be ruled out that ISAT have a true first-order transition in dimension five.
         This latter difference would be intriguing if true. On the other hand, since simulations are more difficult 
         for ISAT than ISAW at this transition in high dimensions, any discrepancy may well be due to the inability

        which are defined to be self-avoiding polygons containing any number of holes, each of which is a self-avoiding polygon. 
        The staircase polygon subset, with staircase holes, is also discussed. The internal holes have no 
        common vertices with each other, nor any common vertices with the surrounding polygon. 
        There are no `holes-within-holes'. We use the finite-lattice method to count the number
         of polygonal polyominoes on the square lattice. Series have been derived for both the 
         perimeter and area generating functions. It is known that while the critical point is 
         unchanged by a finite number of holes, when the number of holes is unrestricted the 
         critical point changes. The area generating function coefficients grow exponentially, 
         with a growth constant greater than that for polygons with a finite number of holes, 
         but less than that of polyominoes. We provide an estimate for this growth constant and 
         prove that it is strictly less than that for polyominoes. Also, we prove that, enumerating by perimeter, 
        the generating function of polygonal polyominoes has zero radius of convergence and

Addendum to `On Three-dimensional Self-avoiding Walk Symmetry Classes’ <br />

        <span id="add3dsymcl" style="display: none"> In two dimensions the universality 
        classes of self-avoiding walks on the square lattice, restricted by allowing only 
        certain two-step configurations to occur within each walk, has been argued to be 
        determined primarily by the symmetry of the set of allowed two-step configurations. 
        In a recent paper (Rechnitzer A and Owczarek A L 2000 On three-dimensional self-avoiding 
        walk symmetry classes J. Phys. A : Math. Gen. 33 2685-723), primarily tackling the three-dimensional 
        analogues of these models, a novel two-dimensional model was discovered that seemed either to break 
        the classification of the models into universality classes according to microscopic symmetry or was 
        itself a member of a novel universality class. This was supported by series analysis of exact enumeration data. 
        Here we provide conclusive evidence that this model, known as `anti-spiral walks', 
        is in the directed walk universality class. We arrive at these conclusions from 
        Monte Carlo simulations of these walks using a PERM algorithm modified for this problem. 
        We point out that the behaviour of this model is unusual in that other models in the 
        directed walk universality class remain directed when the self-avoidance condition is 
        removed, whereas the behaviour of anti-spiral walks becomes that of a isotropic simple
         random walk. We also remark that the symmetry classification of walk models can be kept by 
        adding a natural condition to the scheme that disallows models, all of whose 
        configurations avoid some infinite region of the plane by virtue of their microscopic constraints. </span>

         on the hypercubic lattice with standard interactions at a wide range of temperatures up to length 4096 and at some 
         temperatures up to length 16384. The results confirm the earlier prediction (using data from a non-standard model 
         at a single temperature) of a collapse phase transition occurring at finite temperature. Moreover they are in accord 
         with the phenomenological theory originally proposed by Lifshitz, Grosberg and Khokhlov in three dimensions and 
         recently given new impetus by its use in the description of simulational results for four-dimensional interacting 
         self-avoiding walks (ISAW). In fact, we argue that the available data is consistent with the conclusion that the
          collapse transitions of ISAT and ISAW lie in the same universality class, in contradiction with long-standing predictions. 
          We deduce that there exists a pseudo-first order transition for ISAT in four dimensions at finite lengths while the thermodynamic limit is described
         by the standard polymer mean-field theory (giving a second-order transition), in contradiction to the prediction

         has been argued to be determined primarily by the symmetry of the set of allowed rules. 
         In three dimensions early work tentatively found one (undirected) universality class different 
         to that of unrestricted SAWs on the simple cubic lattice. This rule was a natural generalization 
         of the square lattice `spiral' SAW to three dimensions. In this report we examine a variety of three-dimensional 
         SAW models with different step restrictions, carefully chosen so as to search for a connection between the symmetry
          of the rules and possible new universality classes. A first analysis of the scaling of the 
          radius of gyration suggests several universality classes, including the one found earlier, 
          and perhaps some novel class(es). However, a classification of these universality classes 
          using the symmetries of the rules, or other basic rule properties, is not evident. 
          Further analysis of the number of configurations 
        and moment of inertia tensor suggests that in three dimensions the only non-trivial or

        <span id="fourdcoll" style="display: none"> In an earlier work we provided the first evidence that the collapse, or coil-globule
         transition of an isolated polymer in solution can be seen in a four-dimensional model. Here we investigate, via Monte Carlo simulations,
          the canonical lattice model of polymer collapse, namely, interacting self-avoiding walks, to show that it not 
          only has a distinct collapse transition at finite temperature but that for any finite polymer length this collapse 
          has many characteristics of a rounded first-order phase transition. However, we also show that there exists a “𝜃 point” 
          where the polymer behaves in a simple Gaussian manner (which is a critical state), to which these finite-size transition
           temperatures approach as the polymer length is increased. The resolution of these seemingly incompatible conclusions 
           involves the argument that the first-order-like rounded transition is scaled away in the thermodynamic limit to leave 
           a mean-field second-order transition. Essentially this happens because the finite-size shift of the transition is 
           asymptotically much larger than the width of the pseudotransition and the latent heat decays to zero (algebraically) 
           with polymer length. This scenario can be inferred from the application of the theory of Lifshitz, Grosberg, and Khokhlov 
           (based upon the framework of Lifshitz) to four dimensions: the conclusions of which were written down some time ago by Khokhlov. 
           In fact it is precisely above the upper critical dimension, which is 3 for this problem, that the theory of Lifshitz may be quantitatively applicable to polymer collapse. </span>

        <span id="partdiffmethod" style="display: none"> Many problems concerning lattice paths, especially on the 
        square lattice have been exactly solved. For a single path, many methods exist that allow exact calculation
         regardless of whether the path inhabits a strip, a semi-infinite space or infinite space, or perhaps interacts with the walls.
          It has been shown that a transfer matrix method using the Bethe Ansatz allows for the 
          calculation of the partition function for many non-intersecting paths interacting with a wall.
           This problem can also be considered using the Gessel-Viennot methodology. 
        In a concurrent development, two non-intersecting paths interacting with a wall 
        have been examined in semi-infinite space using a set of partial difference equations.

Here, we review thispartial difference equation method for the case of one path in a half plane. 
We then demonstrate that the answer for arbitrary numbers of non-intersecting paths interacting 
with a wall can be obtained using this method. One reason for doing this is its pedagogical 
value in showing its ease of use compared to the transfer matrix method. 
The solution is expressed in a new form as a “constant term” formula, 
which is readily evaluated. More importantly, it is the natural method that generalizes easily to many 
intersecting paths where there is inter-path interactions (e.g., osculating lattice paths). 
We discuss the relationship of the partial difference equation method to the transfer matrix 
method and their solution via a Bethe Ansatz. </span>

        <span id="anisospiral" style="display: none"> We report on a Monte Carlo study of so-called two-choice-spiral 
        self-avoiding walks on the square lattice. These have the property that their geometric size (such as is 
        measured by the radius of gyration) scales anisotropically, with exponent values that seem to defy rational 
        fraction conjectures. This polymer model was previously understood to be in a universality class different 
        to ordinary self-avoiding walks, directed walks (which are also anisotropic), and symmetric spiral walks, 
        in two dimensions. Our Monte Carlo study concurs with those previous exact enumeration studies in that respect.
         However, we estimate substantially different values for the scaling exponents associated with the 
         geometric size of the walks. We give arguments that explain this difference in terms of a turning 
         point in the local exponent values, and in turn explain this by 
        arguing for the existence of probable logarithmic corrections. We also supply numerical evidence 
        supporting a conjecture concerning the angle of anisotropy in the model. </span>

        Analysis of this data suggests that the walk generating function exponent γ = 1.3385 ± 0.003,

        <span id="cluststruct" style="display: none"> In order to better understand the geometry of the polymer collapse transition, 
        we study the distribution of geometric clusters made up of the nearest neighbor interactions of an interacting self-avoiding walk.
         We argue for this new correlated percolation problem that in two dimensions, and possibly 
         also in three dimensions, a percolation transition takes place at a temperature lower than the 
         collapse transition. Hence this novel transition should be governed by exponents unrelated to the θ-point exponents.
          This also implies that there is a temperature range in which the polymer has collapsed, but has no long-range cluster
           structure. We use Monte Carlo to study the distribution of clusters on the simple cubic and Manhattan lattices.        
           On the Manhattan lattice, where the data are most convincing, we find that the percolation transition occurs      
           at ω p =1.461(3), while the collapse transition is known to occur exactly at ω θ =1.414.... 
           We propose a finite-size scaling form for the

         (bond-avoiding walks) in four dimensions. We use a mapping from a kinetic growth model to a static model of 
         self-interacting trails (ISAT) at a particular temperature to argue that this temperature is precisely the 
         collapse temperature of four-dimensional interacting trails. To do this we show that the kinetic growth trails
          behave neither like static non-interacting trails, which should behave as excluded-volume-dominated 
          four-dimensional polymers (that is self-avoiding walks), or collapsed four-dimensional polymers, 
          but rather show an intermediate behaviour. This is the first indication of collapse in any

          of polymers is a good model in lower dimensions. We have calculated various exponents of the KGT model a
          nd identified them with certain critical exponents of the static ISAT problem.

        <span id="vesiclechains" style="display: none"> In this paper we present new exact results for single fully directed walks and 
        fully directed vesicles near an attractive wall. This involves a novel method of solution for these types of problems. 
        The major advantage of this method is that it, unlike many other single-walker methods, generalizes to an arbitrary number of walkers.
         The method of solution involves solving a set of partial difference equations with a Bethe Ansatz. 
         The solution is expressed as a “constant-term” formula which evaluates to sums of products of binomial coefficients. 
         The vesicle critical temperature is found at which a binding transition takes place, and the asymptotic forms of the a
         ssociated partition functions are found to have three different entropic exponents depending on whether the temperature is above, 
         below, or at its critical value. The expected number of monomers adsorbed onto the surface is found to become proportional to the 
         vesicle length at temperatures below critical. Scaling functions near the critical point are determined.

        partially-directed self-avoiding walks (IPDSAW) in two dimensions. However, we do not restrict the 
        discussion to that model. After describing the properties for a general class of models, and stating 
        exactly what we mean by scaling, we prove the following theorem: If the generating function of 
        finite-size partition functions has a tricritical cross-over scaling form around the theta -point, 
        and the associated tricritical scaling function, g, has a finite radius of convergence, then the

        We point out that given our description of tricritical scaling this theorem should apply

        <span id="mantheta" style="display: none"> Kinetic growth walks (KGW) on the Manhattan lattice 
        have previously been shown to be equivalent to the static problem of interacting self-avoiding walks
        on that lattice at the Θ-temperature. Here, we illustrate how a complete set of exponents for the
         static problem, including the crossover exponent phi and surface exponents at the ordinary and special
          transition points, may be obtained from simulations of kinetic walks. In the process we find that 
          φ  ≃ 0.430+or-0.006 which encompasses the conjectured value 3/7 ≃ 0.42857 for the theta -point 
          on an isotropic lattice. Our numerics confirm a predicted set of exponents for both the bulk and surface
           transitions in addition to results such as the exact internal energy at the bulk transition. Furthermore, 
           we point out that a recently examined variant of the Nienhuis O(n) model can be mapped onto 
         Θ-point walks on the Manhattan lattice which allows identification of the scaling dimensions for that problem and thereby provides a method for proving all the numerical conjectures. </span>

        of special interest and sometimes is assumed to obey the relation 2- alpha =1/ phi with the alpha the canonical (thermodynamic)
         exponent that characterizes the divergence of the specific heat. The reasons for the validity of this relation are not widely known.
          The authors present a scaling theory of collapse transitions in such models. The free energy and canonical 
          partition functions have finite-length scaling forms whilst the grand partition function has a tricritical scaling form. 
          The link between the grand and canonical ensembles leads to the above scaling relation. They then comment on the validity of

        <span id="iraf" style="display: none"> A new model (called the Temperley-Lieb interactions model) is introduced, 
        in two-dimensional lattice statistics, on a square lattice ℒ. 
        The Temperley-Lieb equivalence of this model to the six-vertex, self-dual Potts, critical hard-hexagons and 
        critical nonintersecting string models is established. A
         graphical equivalence of this model to the six-vertex model generalizes 
         this equivalence to noncritical cases of the above models. 
        The order parameters of a specialization of this model are studied. </span>

        <span id="sawhighdad" style="display: none">  It is known that the critical properties of the adsorption transition for
the self-avoiding walk model of lattice polymers are not superuniversal. In particular
this is because the value of the crossover exponent φ in the three-dimensional
case deviates from the mean-field prediction φ = 1/2. The mean-field value is exactly
true for high-dimensional lattices with dimension d > 4, where d = 4 is the
upper critical dimension. These high-dimensional cases have not been studied extensively
and here we employ Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the scaling of
the adsorbed fraction, finding that the expected mean-field scaling holds for d = 5, 6.
However, we do not find additional logarithmic scaling for d = 4, contrary to what
is typically expected for lattice models at the upper critical dimension.</span>

        study of self-avoiding walks and polygons in two dimensions, as well Ising models in both two- and three-dimensions,
         and then focus in greater detail on universal distance ratios for interacting self-avoiding walks. </span>

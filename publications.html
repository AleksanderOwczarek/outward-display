      Lattice polymers near a permeable interface<br />

        <span id="permeable" style="display: none">We study the localisation of lattice polymer models near a permeable interface in two dimensions. Localisation can arise due to an interaction between the polymer and the interface, and can be altered by a preference for the bulk solvent on one side or by the application of a force to manipulate the polymer. Different combinations of these three effects give slightly different statistical mechanical behaviours. The canonical lattice model of polymers is the self-avoiding walk which we mainly study with Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the phase diagram and critical phenomena. For comparison, a solvable directed walk version is also defined and the phase diagrams are compared for each case. We find broad agreement between the two models, and most minor differences can be understood as due to the different entropic contributions. In the limit where the bulk solvent on one side is overwhelmingly preferred we see how the localisation transition transforms to the adsorption transition; the permeable interface becomes effectively an impermeable surface. </span>

        Exact solution of weighted partially directed walks crossing a square<br />
        <i>Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical</i> <b>56</b> (2023) 155003<br />

        <span id="pdwsinboxes" style="display: none">We consider partially directed walks crossing a $L\times L$ square weighted according to their length by a fugacity $t$. The exact solution of this model is computed in three different ways, depending on whether $t$ is less than, equal to or greater than 1. In all cases a complete expression for the dominant asymptotic behaviour of the partition function is calculated. The model admits a dilute to dense phase transition, where for $0 < t < 1$ the partition function scales exponentially in $L$ whereas for $t>1$ the partition function scales exponentially in $L^2$, and when $t=1$ there is an intermediate scaling which is exponential in $L \log{L}$. As such we provide an exact solution of a model of the dilute to dense polymeric phase transition in two dimensions.</span>

        <span id="kreweras2" style="display: none">Lattice paths in the quarter plane have led to a large and varied set of results in recent years. One major project has been the classification of step sets according to the properties of the corresponding generating functions, and this has involved a variety of techniques, some highly intricate and specialised. The famous Kreweras and reverse Kreweras walk models are two particularly interesting models, as they are among the only four cases which have algebraic generating functions. <br /><br />

        Here we investigate how the properties of the Kreweras and reverse Kreweras models change when boundary interactions are introduced. That is, we associate three real-valued weights a,b,c with visits by the walks to the x-axis, the y-axis and the origin (0,0) respectively. These models were partially solved in a recent paper by Beaton, Owczarek and Rechnitzer (2019). We apply the algebraic kernel method to completely solve these two models. We find that reverse Kreweras walks have an algebraic generating function for all a,b,c, regardless of whether the walks are restricted to end at the origin or on one of the axes, or may end anywhere at all. For Kreweras walks, the generating function for walks returning to the origin is algebraic, but the other cases are only D-finite.  <br /><br />

        We also compare these two models with the other solvable cases, and observe that they have some unique properties.</span>

        <span id="zipping" style="display: none">We provide the exact solution of several variants of simple models of the zipping transition of two bound polymers, such as occurs in DNA/RNA, in two and three dimensions using pairs of directed lattice paths. In three dimensions the solutions are written in terms of complete elliptic integrals. We analyse the phase transition associated with each model giving the scaling of the partition function. We also extend the models to include a pulling force between one end of the pair of paths, which competes with the attractive monomer-monomer interactions between the polymers. </span>

        <span id="kreweras" style ="display: none">We study lattice paths in the quarter-plane which accrue weights with each visit to the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the origin. In particular, we address two cases which were only partially solved in a recent work by Beaton, Owczarek and Rechnitzer (2018): Kreweras and reverse Kreweras paths. Without weights these are two of the famous algebraic quarter-plane models. We show that the reverse Kreweras model remains algebraic for all possible weights, while the nature of the Kreweras model appears to depend on the value of the weights and the endpoint of the paths.</span>

        <span id="quarterplane" style ="display: none">The set of random walks with different step sets (of short steps) in the quarter plane has provided a rich set of models that have profoundly different integrability properties. In particular, 23 of the 79 effectively different models can be shown to have generating functions that are algebraic or differentiably finite. Here we investigate how this integrability may change in those 23 models where in addition to length one also counts the number of sites of the walk touching either the horizontal and/or vertical boundaries of the quarter plane. This is equivalent to introducing interactions with those boundaries in a statistical mechanical context. We are able to solve for the generating function in a number of cases. For example, when counting the total number of boundary sites without differentiating whether they are horizontal or vertical, we can solve the generating function of a generalised Kreweras model. However, in many instances we are not able to solve as the kernel methodology seems to break down when including counts with the boundaries.</span>
